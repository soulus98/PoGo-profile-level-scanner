# v1.5 (2021-Aug-5)
* Changed the logs posting to a url rather than a whole image, to stop the bot from triple-handling the image. Should increase performance significantly.
* Changed the amount of info that is dumped during the "Stream equals empty buffer" error. I suspect this error just means the server failed to retain the image information due to overloading.

#### v1.5.1
* Start of modularization updates (aka "Mod:"). I moved the command handler to "handlers/commands.js" and dateToTime() to "fun/dateToTime.js"

# v1.4 (2021-Aug-2)
* Added ]stats and analytics
* Added date to the logs
* Added ]ver for checking the version number
* Added a "message.author" tag in the dm messages
* Added emoji (and names) in the "React failed" error messages  
* Bot no longer yells at you for images in the wrong channel

Stats.json will be: created automatically by the bot, saved every image, and loaded on launch.
So far tracked are: Attempts; Declined from scanning due to â€¢Blacklist, â€¢Left the server before processing, â€¢Has all 3 roles already; Fails, and Under 30s.  
The declined images aren't scanned, so they shouldn't be included when calculating a success rate.  
The rest of the successes are sorted by level, so you can see a distribution.  
Maybe one day I can make ]stats show a graph ðŸ˜‚

#### v1.4.1 (2021-Aug-3)
* Removed an accidental testing console log

#### v1.4.2 (2021-Aug-3)
* Changed up how ]stats works so that it is more accurate.

I honestly don't understand how stats.js references the stats collection, but it works, so oh well.



# v1.3
Fixed a few bugs:
* Fixed the blacklist and ]cbl  
* Made the blacklist clear old accounts every 50 images  
* Made it post in logsChannel if an image was declined due to blacklist
* Renamed ]quit to ]restart and reworked ]quit
* Added a check for a result of 00, treating it as an error
* Removed "New Member added" message and welcome message
* Added a modmail tag to fail dm and blacklist dm
* All round better error checking
* Properly delayed the profile Channel tag by 3 seconds

#### v1.3.1
* Added an infodump for if the empty buffer issue reoccurs

#### v1.3.2
* Emergency fix to a new bug in the logs channel process

#### v1.3.3 (2021-Aug-2)
* Fixed the blacklist (again) and added a check for an empty blacklist.json file
* Changed the check to every 30 messages, since it will now not fire for failed or blacklisted images.

The blacklist.json file should now be created (at launch and every 30) if it doesn't already exist, so feel free to delete it if it breaks again (?!) and gets too big.



# v1.1
* Added manage_guild to ]set, ]tog, ]show, ]quit
* Fixed the config.json ]set issue (I think)
* Reworded bot messages for joining, leaving, and quitting
* Added time to the logs
* Made a logs channel (requires a new setting, logsChannel)
* Added/fixed "And it was delayed for x seconds" in logs
* Fixed a tiny oversight in ]prune
* Made the joining, leaving, and quitting messages sometimes get auto-deleted (based on msg time or if they are within the last 20 msg when joining)

#### v1.1.1
* Fixed #37
* Added a profile channel for tags afterwards
* Reworded a few things

#### v1.1.2
* Added a 2 second delay to the profileChannel message
* Added a check for a member having no roles
* Added a check for members having dms turned off
