/* eslint quotes: ["error", "backtick"]*/

/* Who even uses config files, just use pure code. lol

	You can use `backticks` to create what is called a called a "template literal"
	Template literal strings can stretch over multiple lines, but include white space charaters,
	so please be careful with formatting spaces, tabs, indents, newlines, etc
	This whole file is one big object, so like JSON, you need commas at the end of strings and whatnot

	My custom auto-replace options here are:
		<prefix>
		<targetLevel>
		<screenshotChannel>
		<profileChannel>
		<logsChannel>
		<targetLevelRole>
		<level40Role>
		<level50Role>
		<modRole> (this will show as @deleted-role in dms)
		<member>
		<level>
	Check error logs when including <member> and <level>, sometimes they aren't available
	The rest should work
	Here's hoping

:small_blue_diamond: Please post your screenshot in: <screenshotChannel> or reply to this message.

:small_blue_diamond: If you are under <targetLevel>, feel free to join our sister server, linked in <screenshotChannel>.

Good luck, trainer!`,

We are sorry, but you are currently prohibited from using the automated system due to a recent screenshot that was scanned under level <targetLevel>.
If you have surpassed level <targetLevel>, respond to this message to speak to the staff team.
Otherwise, keep leveling up, and post your screenshot when you have reached that point.
Hope to raid with you soon! :wave:`,

Thank you so much for your interest in joining our raid server.
Unfortunately we have a level requirement of <targetLevel> to gain full access, and your screenshot was scanned at <level>.
If this level is incorrect, please reply to this message to speak to the staff.
Gaining xp is very easy to do now with friendships, events, lucky eggs and so much more! Please stay and hang out with us here.
You can use <#733418314222534826> to add other trainers and get the xp you need to hit level <targetLevel>!
Once you've reached that point, please repost your screenshot, or message this bot to alert the staff team, if you need to be let in manually.

In the meantime please join our sister server with this link.
Hope to raid with you soon! :slight_smile:
